## Welcome to the Dumbest Chatting Experience of your life!

Dumb Chat, is a silly way to talk with your friends (who are next to you) via a Terminal.

Indeed, you must have no job and nothing to do with your life, to use this technology but it's a great starting point, and introduction to communication in C.

I know! Nobody works in communication knows anything about C, but it is what it is. 

This was made for my friend for his C Project last year, in a coffee shop.

So you must understand that it's really a retarded piece of code.

Have fun with it. Don't forget to read the code before executing as there are some files you must create before running the code (it can create them by itself, I just want you to read the code).

😁👍
